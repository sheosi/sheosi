**Sergio Tortosa**  
🦀 Rustacean Nerd & C++ Wizard 🧙♂️

Passionate about crafting high-performance solutions with Rust and C++, I build websites that dazzle and systems that inspire. When I'm not conjuring code, you can find me tinkering with innovative projects like **Lily**, my custom voice assistant, or automating documentation workflows because, let's face it, no one likes doing that manually! 😊

**Key Achievements:**
- **Lily**: My very own voice assistant, a distributed system with a custom protocol. Think of it as my answer to the smart home universe!
- **AutoDoc**: A website that auto-generates documentation because who doesn't love saving time?

**Tech Stack:**
- **Proficient In:** Rust, C++, Go, Svelte, and a medley of Rust web frameworks.
- **Currently Learning:** Roc ⚡ and Zig 🛠️ because the quest for better tools is never-ending!

**Looking Ahead:**
I'm on the hunt for exciting freelance opportunities. Let's build something amazing together! 🚀 Whether it's a distributed system or a sleek web app, I'm all in for the challenge.

Let's create magic, one line of code at a time. ✨
